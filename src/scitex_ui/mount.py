"""Tell the page where it is mounted — the SERVER half of the dual-mode contract.

``static/scitex_ui/ts/_base/mount.ts`` reads a mount marker out of the document
and THROWS when none is present, because a guessed root mount works perfectly
standalone and fails only once embedded. That reader shipped in 0.12.0 with
nothing in this package emitting a marker for it to read: every scitex-ui
template emitted neither spelling, so a GUI that adopted ``mountPrefix()`` in
standalone mode got a ``MountPrefixMissingError``. A reader with no writer is
not half a feature; it is a feature that reaches nobody.

This module is the writer. :func:`mount_context` produces the context that
``_mount_marker.html`` renders, and ``standalone_shell.html`` includes that
partial in its ``<head>``.

WHAT "MOUNT PREFIX" MEANS: the part of the URL that belongs to the mount rather
than to the app. Standalone that is ``""``; as a scitex-hub built-in it is
``/apps/u/<module_name>``. Client code joins app-relative paths onto it, so it
carries no trailing slash and root is the empty string.

WHY THE VIEW MUST DECLARE ITS OWN ROUTE, and why there is deliberately NO
context processor here. ``request.path`` is the whole path — mount prefix AND
whatever route the view occupies inside the app. Subtracting the view's own
route is the only way to recover the prefix, and only the view knows that route
because the view is what wrote it in ``urls.py``. A context processor cannot
know it, so it would be silently correct for views at the app root and silently
WRONG for every other view. That is strictly worse than the throw this whole
contract is built on: a wrong prefix is indistinguishable from a right one until
a request 404s in production. So the caller passes ``view_path`` and a mismatch
raises.

Django's ``resolver_match.route`` looks like it should supply this and does not:
under ``include()`` it is the FULL concatenated pattern, so subtracting it
yields ``"/"``. scitex-app measured that directly and rejected it; recorded here
so it is not rediscovered as a clever shortcut.

``request.path``, never ``request.path_info``: ``path_info`` has ``SCRIPT_NAME``
stripped, which is exactly the prefix we are trying to read. That one is easy to
get backwards and, again, fails only when embedded.

AND NEVER ADD ``SCRIPT_NAME`` BACK ON. ``request.path`` ALREADY CONTAINS IT --
Django composes the two, at ``django/core/handlers/wsgi.py:67``::

    self.path = "%s/%s" % (script_name.rstrip("/"), path_info.replace("/", "", 1))

So ``request.META["SCRIPT_NAME"] + request.path`` does not harden anything; it
DOUBLES the prefix under precisely the convention it looks like it is guarding
against::

    SCRIPT_NAME=/apps/u/writer, PATH_INFO=/editor/
    request.path                ->  /apps/u/writer/editor/                  correct
    SCRIPT_NAME + request.path  ->  /apps/u/writer/apps/u/writer/editor/    WRONG

This is written down because it was proposed in review, in good faith, as a
change that would be "identical today and immune under both conventions". It is
identical only while ``SCRIPT_NAME`` is empty -- i.e. only in the case that never
exercises it -- so testing it standalone proves nothing and the bug ships. Two
readers reasoned their way to it independently, which is the signal that a
comment is not enough: see ``test_script_name_is_not_added_back_on`` for the
mechanical guard.

The upshot is that ``request.path`` is correct under BOTH conventions by
construction. A hub that mounts sub-apps by URL prefix and a hub that mounts them
via ``SCRIPT_NAME`` produce the same ``request.path``, so this derivation does
not depend on any dispatcher choosing not to rewrite it.

Usage in a view::

    from scitex_ui.branding import shell_context
    from scitex_ui.mount import mount_context

    def editor(request):                     # urls.py: path("editor/", editor)
        return render(request, "myapp/index.html", {
            **shell_context("Writer"),
            **mount_context(request, view_path="editor/"),
        })

An app that does not merge :func:`mount_context` gets no marker, and client code
calling ``mountPrefix()`` throws. That is the intended failure: loud, immediate,
and identical in both modes.
