    """In-app "How to use": a `?` help panel + first-open coach-mark tour.

    One per-app steps file (JSON/YAML, EN/JA) feeds both surfaces. A leaf
    declares its steps and calls ``{% stx_help "<app>" steps_json="..." %}``
    — the tag renders the `?` button and the guide payload, the prebuilt
    module auto-mounts every ``[data-stx-help]`` root and exposes
    ``window.stxHelp.open()/close()/replay()``. Steps with a ``target``
    selector are tour stops; steps without one are plain panel content.
    The first-open tour runs once per app (``stx-help:<app>:done`` in
    localStorage) and can be replayed from the panel footer.
