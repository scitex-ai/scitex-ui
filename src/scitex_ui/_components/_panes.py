    An app declares its columns as panes (``[data-stx-panes]`` with

    At <=640px a sticky tab bar (icon + short label, 44px) switches the single
    visible pane; a horizontal swipe moves to the adjacent tab unless it starts
    in a horizontal scroller or a text field. The active pane is remembered per
    app in sessionStorage; ``window.stxPanes.show(id)`` switches it from code and
    ``stx-panes:change`` reports each switch. ``<details class="stx-acc">`` is the
    accordion for secondary settings inside a pane.
