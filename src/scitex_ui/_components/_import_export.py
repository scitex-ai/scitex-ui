class ImportExport:
    """The standard import/export pattern (compass L623).

    A trigger opens a panel of FORMAT OPTIONS (BibTeX, RIS, CSL JSON,
    Zotero, Markdown, PDF, ...); picking one shows a confirm bar;
    confirming emits ``stx-import-export:confirm`` (bubbles, detail
    ``{direction, formatId, formatLabel}``) and the consuming app
    performs the transfer.

    The component owns the pattern — the markup, the BEM vocabulary, the
    confirm/cancel flow, and the event contract. It does NOT own the data
    (which formats exist is the app's) or the bytes (reading a file,
    writing a citation file). The confirm/cancel bar uses the standard
    ``.stx-button`` (form-controls) rather than re-defining buttons.

    The confirm step exists because a format list is long enough that an
    accidental tap on "Zotero" should not immediately fire a transfer.
