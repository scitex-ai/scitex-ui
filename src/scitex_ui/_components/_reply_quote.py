class ReplyQuote:
    """Truncated, clickable quote of the message being replied to.

    Built base-first at scitex-cards' request so the chat never grows a
    private one. Activating it scrolls to the original and flashes it.

    Colour-agnostic by construction: it sits inside a bubble that is already
    colour-coded by sender, so the stylesheet derives its tint, accent bar and
    focus ring from ``currentColor`` rather than choosing its own. Drop it into
    any bubble and it takes that bubble's colour, with nothing to configure
    per sender.

    A quote whose original cannot be reached renders ORPHANED — visibly inert
    — instead of staying clickable and silently doing nothing.
