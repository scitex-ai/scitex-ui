"""Dim component metadata.

The presentation half of an authorization verdict: a control that stays
visible and reachable while being unusable, carrying the reason it is
unusable and — where the verdict offers one — the route out.

Why this is a state of its own and not ``.disabled``
----------------------------------------------------
"Broken / not usable" and "available once you sign in" are different
facts. Rendering them identically tells a user that signing in will not
help, which is the login-wall behaviour the operator's ruling explicitly
rules out (2026-09-02: dimmed, visible, not hidden, not a wall).

The verdict itself is produced by ``scitex_app.authz`` and crosses the
package boundary as plain serialisable data. ``scitex-ui`` does NOT
depend on ``scitex-app``: an app depends on both, so importing the SDK
here would point that arrow backwards.

Design follows the same shape as :mod:`._tooltip` — Python registry stub
here, TS + CSS in ``static/scitex_ui/``.
