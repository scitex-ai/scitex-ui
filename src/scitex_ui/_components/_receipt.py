    """Delivery receipt: one mark that advances through its delivery states.

    The claude-code-telegrammer model — a single mark that ADVANCES, not a row
    of indicators. Built base-first at scitex-cards' request so their chat
    never grows a private one.

    Four states, and ``unknown`` is the default: ``unknown`` (no signal yet),
    ``sent`` (reached the store), ``seen`` (reached the recipient), ``failed``
    (delivery known dead). A read/unread boolean cannot express "we do not
    know", and collapsing that into either pole reports undelivered messages as
    delivered. Setting an unrecognised state raises rather than falling back to
    ``unknown``, which would hide a failure behind "no signal yet".
