    A dropdown with fuzzy search that lists the projects the user can access,
    shows the current selection on the trigger, and emits
    ``stx-project-selector:change`` (bubbles, detail ``{id, name}``).

    A project-scope app places it in its own UI, never the global header:
    ``{% load scitex_project_picker %}{% scitex_project_picker provider_url=... %}``
    renders nothing for user-scope apps. The list comes from a
    ``ProjectProvider`` (``scitex_ui.project_scope`` on the server,
    ``httpProjectProvider`` in TS), so the component knows nothing about
    permissions. Keyboard: arrows, Enter, Escape; 44px targets on touch.
