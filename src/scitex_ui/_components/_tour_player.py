    SSOT: scitex-hub PR 923 §8. Two properties are the reason this exists rather
    than a hand-rolled ``<video>`` per app:

    - **Switching a language must not lose the viewer's place.** A JA viewer
      switches language mid-tour, and a switch that silently restarts the video
      reads as losing your place. Position and play state are captured before the
      source swap and restored after it (immediately, and again on
      ``loadedmetadata``, because the seek only sticks once metadata is in).
    - **The recording pipeline locates controls by data attribute, never by
      label.** §8 drives ONE action timeline to produce both the EN and the JA
      recording, so any locator containing prose cannot survive the second
      locale. Every control publishes ``data-stx-player-act``.

    The audio and subtitle choices are independent: a viewer may want JA audio
    with EN subtitles, and setting one must not reset the other.
