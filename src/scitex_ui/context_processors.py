    The standard dev-visibility gate (compass L628): development-only UI is
    hidden by default and shown on a deliberate, per-deployment signal.

    Precedence, first match wins:

    1. An explicit per-feature setting, when one is declared for ``name`` in
       ``_FEATURE_OVERRIDE_SETTINGS`` and is set (not ``None``). This is the
       knob deployments use to turn a feature on in develop + staging and off
       in production, independent of ``DEBUG``.
    2. ``settings.DEBUG`` — on for local development.
    3. Authenticated staff users — so a feature stays reachable in production
       for operators without exposing it to end users.
    4. Otherwise off.

    ``request.user`` may be a lazy, DB-backed object (unsafe to evaluate on an
    ASGI event loop), so this function is the single place that touches it.
    The element-inspector middleware runs the whole injection off the loop and
    delegates here, rather than re-reading the user itself — keeping one source
    of truth for the precedence.

    ``name`` is not validated against ``DEV_FEATURE_NAMES`` on purpose: this is
    the general mechanism, and a caller asking about a feature that isn't
    registered simply gets the ``DEBUG`` / staff answer (a feature with no
    explicit knob is dev-gated by default).
