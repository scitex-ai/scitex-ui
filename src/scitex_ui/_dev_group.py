"""The §13 `dev` group and the §1a legacy `skills` alias.

Extracted from ``_cli.py`` (530 lines, over the 512 limit) so the entry-point
module holds wiring rather than doctrine. PR #165 proposed this same extraction
with these same two entry points on 2026-08-22; it went green, was never
merged, and drifted 29 commits behind while its FEATURE landed inline in
``_cli.py`` by another route. The naming here is that PR's, kept deliberately.

§13 vs §1a — TWO DOCTRINES ASK FOR OPPOSITE THINGS, and this module is where
they meet. Both are quoted rather than paraphrased, because the resolution only
makes sense if you can see that neither was ignored.

  §1a, 03_required-introspection-commands.md:98-104 —
    "If the package ships `_skills/<pkg>/`, `<cli> skills` exists as a group
     with `list`, `get`, and `install` subcommands. SELF-CONTAINED (no
     scitex-dev runtime dep) so users can introspect bundled skills without
     discovering the ecosystem-wide tooling first."

  §13, 20_dev-commands.md — `skills` is one of SIX FIXED verbs that mount under
    `dev`. The doctrine is explicit that the six NAMES are fixed even though
    the verbs inside each are not.

So §1a wants `scitex-ui skills` to exist and §13 wants it gone from top level.

THE AUDITOR'S HINT DOES NOT WORK HERE. It offers
``scitex_dev.ecosystem.deprecated_alias()``, which imports scitex-dev — and
scitex-dev is this package's OPTIONAL [cli] extra (pyproject
``[project.optional-dependencies] cli``). Routing the §1a-mandated command
through it would hand that command a scitex-dev runtime dependency and break it
for every install without the extra, which is the exact thing §1a's
"self-contained" clause exists to prevent. The hint is right about the SHAPE and
wrong about the MECHANISM, so the alias below is plain click.

THE FLEET ALREADY SOLVED THIS, one line away in §1a's own file (:23), for
``list-python-apis``: "the legacy top-level mount stays as a Phase W
warn-forward alias during migration". Same collision, same answer — canonical
under ``dev``, legacy top level kept and warning.

    still work.

    The warning goes to STDERR (§14) so it can never corrupt ``--json`` output
    being piped into something — that is the difference between a migration aid
    and the breakage it exists to avoid.

    help-spec coverage sees a spec), plain ``click.Group`` when it is not (so
