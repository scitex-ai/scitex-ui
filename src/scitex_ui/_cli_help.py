"""Resolve scitex-dev's CliHelp surface WITHOUT importing it at module scope.

Two ecosystem rules pull in opposite directions here, and this module is the
only place that reconciles them:

  §4b   a command's help must be constructed via ``CliHelp`` rather than left
        as a free-form docstring. The audit checks one thing — whether the
        command object carries a non-None ``_help_spec``.

  PS-213  console-script-deps-must-be-core. ``scitex_ui._cli:main`` is the
        entry point for the ``scitex-ui`` script, so anything it imports at
        module scope must be a CORE dependency. ``scitex-dev`` is NOT: it is
        the optional ``[cli]`` extra.

Importing ``SpecCommand`` at the top of ``_cli.py`` would satisfy §4b and break
PS-213 — a bare ``pip install scitex-ui`` followed by ``scitex-ui --help`` would
raise ModuleNotFoundError. So the classes are resolved LAZILY, at decoration
time, and fall back to plain click when scitex-dev is absent.

Both rules end up honoured rather than exempted:

  * PS-213 holds because no optional dependency is imported unguarded.
  * §4b holds WHERE IT RUNS. The audit only executes in environments that have
    scitex-dev installed, and in exactly those environments the real
    ``SpecCommand`` is used and ``_help_spec`` is set.

THE FALLBACK IS NOT A SILENT FAILURE. Without the extra the help still renders,
via click's ordinary docstring path — it is simply unstructured. That is the
documented behaviour of an optional extra, not a degraded mode pretending to be
the real one. `help_available()` reports which path is live so a caller (or a
test) can tell the two apart rather than guessing.

The same shape already exists in this package: ``_linter/_rules.py`` resolves
scitex-dev's ``Rule`` this way after a module-scope import of it silently
deactivated the entire UI rule corpus (#141). This is that lesson applied
before the fact rather than after.

PS-233 — RUNTIME-IMPORT GUARD, ONE SITE
---------------------------------------
``_ecosystem_surface()`` below is the only place this module imports
scitex-dev, and that import sits inside ``try/except ImportError``. That guard
is not decoration, and it is the reason scitex-dev stays an optional ``[cli]``
extra instead of moving into ``[project.dependencies]``:

  * The rule reads IMPORT SITES. The ``find_spec`` pre-check answers "is
    scitex-dev installed"; it does not answer "can this name be imported right
    now", which is a different question — a partial or mid-upgrade install
    passes the first and fails the second — and a branch before an import is
    not a guard around it to a static scan.
  * Degradation is DEFINED and identical to the absent path: None / () / {},
    which is click's docstring help, this module's documented behaviour
    without the extra.
  * It is not a silent ``pass``. The capability's absence is the contract of
    an optional extra, and ``help_available()`` is the caller-visible signal
    for which world is live.
