"""Linter plugin for scitex-ui: UI-101..105 component-usage rules.

Registered via entry point `scitex_dev.linter.plugins` so the rules
appear in `scitex-linter list-rules` once both `scitex-ui` and
`scitex-dev` are installed.

The `checkers` slot is intentionally empty — scitex-dev's in-tree
checker dispatch is Python-AST-only (each `checker_cls(lines,
config).visit(tree)` is called against the .py AST), and the rules
below target CSS / HTML / TSX file surfaces. Active scanning of those
files is provided by the standalone walker in
:mod:`scitex_ui._linter._checker`, invoked via the `scitex-ui lint`
CLI subcommand (see :mod:`scitex_ui._linter._cli`). The two paths are
complementary: registration here makes the rule corpus discoverable
via the canonical entry-point; enforcement happens via the CLI walker
that knows how to read non-Python files.

Doctrine: `src/scitex_ui/_skills/scitex-ui/40_component-usage-doctrine.md`.
