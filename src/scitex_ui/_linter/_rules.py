Imported by both:
- :mod:`scitex_ui._linter_plugin` — the entry-point that registers the
  rules with scitex-dev's linter (visible via ``scitex-linter list-rules``).
- :mod:`scitex_ui._linter._checker` — the standalone CSS/HTML/TSX
  walker that actively flags violations.

Severity ramp note for UI-104: the rule starts as ``warning`` in scitex-ui
0.6.0 and is scheduled to flip to ``error`` in 0.7.0 (standard adoption
window). Plan migrations off shared-foundation CSS edits in the WARN window.
The flip is documented in the rule message and the doctrine MD; the version
gate is enforced at the rule-build site below.

    Importing scitex-dev's ``Rule`` at MODULE SCOPE — which this module did
    until 2026-08-09 — closes a loop that leaves this package's entire rule
    corpus inactive:

        import scitex_ui._linter._rules
          -> from scitex_dev.linter._rules._base import Rule   (module scope)
          -> scitex_dev.linter.__init__ runs _register_sweep_cli()
          -> ... which reaches scitex-dev's plugin loader
          -> loader imports scitex_ui._linter_plugin, calls get_plugin()
          -> get_plugin() needs build_rules from THIS module
          -> but we are still on the import line above: build_rules is
             not yet defined
          -> ImportError, caught by the loader, plugin dropped

    The loader does not fail on that — it warns and carries on, so a run
    with the UI rules ACTIVE and a run with them INACTIVE differ only by one
    line of yellow text (measured: 41 rules / 7 UI vs 34 / 0).

    Deferring to first ATTRIBUTE ACCESS fixes it because every access
    happens inside :func:`build_rules`, i.e. after this module has finished
    initialising — so the loader's re-entrant import finds ``build_rules``
    present. Deferring into ``get_plugin`` instead does NOT work and was
    tried: the loader CALLS ``get_plugin()`` during load, so the import
    lands back inside the same partially-initialised module microseconds
    later.
