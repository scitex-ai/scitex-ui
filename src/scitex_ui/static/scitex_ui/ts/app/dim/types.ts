/**
 * Type definitions for the Dim component — the presentation half of an
 * authorization verdict.
 *
 * THE VERDICT IS PRODUCED ELSEWHERE. `scitex_app.authz` builds it; this package
 * only renders it. The value crosses the package boundary as PLAIN SERIALISABLE
 * DATA (scitex-app's `Verdict.to_dict()`), which is why scitex-ui does not and
 * must not depend on scitex-app: an app depends on both of us, so importing the
 * SDK here would point that arrow backwards and every consumer would inherit it
 * through the presentation layer.
 *
 * THE KIND STRINGS BELOW ARE A SECOND COPY of scitex_app.authz's, in another
 * repo, and nothing in this file can detect a rename on their side.
 * Deliberately not numbered here: this sentence said "THE FOUR" until
 * `unresolved` was added 2026-09-05, so the count went stale on the very first
 * addition and did so SILENTLY, which is what prose gets wrong that a test gets
 * right. The count is asserted in
 * tests/develop/test_dim_renders_a_verdict.py, where growing the union turns it
 * red instead of leaving a comment quietly lying to the next reader.
 * scitex-app is building the check that can (it reads these constants out of
 * this package's shipped source), and it runs on THEIR side deliberately: the
 * breakage would appear here, but the cause is there, so a check nearest the
 * rename prevents rather than detects. Their caveat, recorded because it is
 * load-bearing: that leg is currently a RECORD, not a required context.
 *
 * EACH KIND RECORDS THE RELEASE IT FIRST SHIPPED IN, and that is not
 * decoration. A consumer comparing its own kind set against this file cannot
 * otherwise tell two different situations apart:
 *
 *     installed scitex-ui predates the kind   the contract cannot be evaluated
 *     installed scitex-ui postdates it        the contract is VIOLATED
 *
 * Without the version those collapse into one red, and the honest answer to the
 * first is "unknown" rather than "no" — the three-valued rule, applied to a
 * cross-package check. scitex-app hit exactly this on 2026-09-05: their CI
 * installs scitex-ui unpinned, so a propagation-window install of an older
 * wheel reported a contract violation that was true of the installation and
 * false of the contract.
 *
 * These are HISTORICAL facts, which is why they are safe to write here when a
 * claim about scitex-app's current implementation would not be. "unresolved
 * ships from 0.20.2" cannot stop being true; "scitex-app parses this union"
 * stops being true the day they change it, silently, with nothing to catch it.
 * Measured from the published wheels rather than recalled — 0.19.1 has no
 * types.ts at all, 0.20.0 and 0.20.1 carry four kinds, 0.20.2 carries five.

 * user "no" when the truth is "we could not ask", and collapsing it into
 * `allowed` would open a control on a permission nobody verified.
 *
 * ADDED 2026-09-05, and only because the implementation demanded it. The
 * standing agreement with scitex-app was that a fifth kind arrives when a
 * concrete case has no verdict to return, decided jointly — not whenever one
 * seems tidy. That case is the A/B decomposition's tri-state resolve: when
 * resolution is ATTEMPTED AND FAILS there is no member of the previous four
 * that is true.
 *
 * ONE kind, not one per axis. Per-axis variants would multiply with every new
 * axis and leak which axis failed, which is system-internal structure.
