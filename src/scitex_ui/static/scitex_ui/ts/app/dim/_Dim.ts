/**
 * Dim — render an authorization verdict onto a control that stays visible.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { applyVerdict } from 'scitex_ui/ts/app/dim';
 *   applyVerdict(button, { kind: "denied-because-not-signed-in",
 *                          sign_in_url: "/accounts/signin" });
 *
 * WHY `aria-disabled` AND NEVER THE `disabled` ATTRIBUTE. The operator's ruling
 * is that a feature you cannot use yet stays VISIBLE and INACTIVE — not hidden,
 * and not behind a login wall. `disabled` removes the control from tab order,
 * which takes the explanation with it: a keyboard user would never reach the
 * one piece of text telling them that signing in would fix this. `aria-disabled`
 * keeps the control focusable and describable while still announcing that it
 * cannot be operated. That single choice is most of the accessibility argument
 * for dim existing as its own state.
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT USE THE TOOLTIP COMPONENT. `app/tooltip` binds `mouseenter`
 * and `mouseleave` only — no focus, no `aria-describedby` (measured 2026-09-03).
 * It is mouse-only, so delegating the reason to it would put the explanation
 * exactly where a keyboard user cannot get it, undoing the reason we chose
 * `aria-disabled` in the first place. Dim therefore owns its accessible
 * description. The tooltip's missing focus support is a real defect in its own
 * right and is carded separately rather than fixed here, so that a change to
 * tooltips and a change to dim never land together with one observable
 * difference between them.
