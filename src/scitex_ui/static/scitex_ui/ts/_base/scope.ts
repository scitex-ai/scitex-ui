/**
 * stx-app-scope — who am I scoped to? (consumer half of the scitex-app SDK
 * contract, operator ledger #48 / #144-149, PR scitex-app #185 @ d8528de4).
 *
 * The SERVER (scitex_app's `_app_scope.py`) declares each leaf app's scope in
 * its manifest and, for PROJECT-scoped apps ONLY, injects a marker into the
 * document head:
 *
 *     <meta name="stx-app-scope" content="project">
 *
 * A user-scoped app (or one that omits `scope` — the SDK's safe default)
 * emits NOTHING. That asymmetry is the whole contract, and it inverts the
 * reader's semantics relative to the sibling stx-mount marker in
 * ./mount.ts:
 *
 *   stx-mount    missing  -> ERROR (an app can't guess where it is mounted)
 *   stx-app-scope missing  -> "user" (the safe direction: NO selector)
 *
 * So `appScope()` NEVER throws on absence. The one thing it refuses is a
 * GUESS: an unrecognised value (a typo'd scope, a third value the contract
 * later added) must not silently read as "user" and suppress a project
 * selector the app needs. It raises on unknown content, exactly the way
 * scitex-app's `normalize_scope` raises on a typo'd manifest scope — the
 * two ends of the same closed enum failing loud rather than degrading.
 *
 * This module is dependency-free (reads a meta tag, returns a string) so it
 * can be used by both the app-local selector host (./shell/app-scope-
 * selector.ts) and plain consumer scripts. It is the consumer-side twin of
 * scitex_app's producer-side _app_scope.py: same meta name, same value set,
 * mirrored precedence.
