"""Django app configuration for scitex-ui.

``ScitexUiConfig.ready()`` auto-wires the element inspector (the Alt+I
visual-debugging overlay) into the host project's settings, so every
scitex GUI app that lists ``scitex_ui`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` gets it in
develop/staging **without** hand-wiring middleware or a context processor.

This closes the copy-paste settings drift that silently left some apps
(scitex-writer, figrecipe) without Alt+I while others (scitex-todo) had it:
the shared shell already pulls in the inspector partial with ``{% include %}``,
but the
partial no-ops unless the flag is produced by the context processor or the
middleware — a hidden, easy-to-forget per-app opt-in. Auto-wiring makes the
opt-in the default and template-independent.
