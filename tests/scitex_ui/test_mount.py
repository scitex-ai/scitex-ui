"""The server half of the dual-mode contract: emit the mount prefix.

``ts/_base/mount.ts`` reads a mount marker and throws when there is none. That
reader shipped with nothing in this package emitting a marker, so a GUI adopting
``mountPrefix()`` in standalone mode got a ``MountPrefixMissingError``. These
tests pin the writer: the derivation, and — the part that actually failed last
time — that the marker reaches the rendered ``standalone_shell.html``.

# mirror it (PS-204), and these arms are the render-equivalent half — the shell
# is rendered through Django's own engine and the emitted DOM is read back,
# because the defect being guarded only appears once a template RUNS ("mount.ts
# shipped correct and unreachable because no template fed it", one layer up).
