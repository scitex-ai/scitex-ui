"""Tests for ``scitex-ui lint`` — the CLI surface and its coverage notice.

The notice exists because "no violations found" is indistinguishable from
"nothing was looked at" unless the output says what it could not see.
scitex-dev made that a requirement on the EMITTED VERDICT rather than the
docs (2026-07-29), and STX-UI106 is a live example of the gap: it counts
``<option>`` tags in source, so a ``<select>`` populated at runtime is
invisible to it.
