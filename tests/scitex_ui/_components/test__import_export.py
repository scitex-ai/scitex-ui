"""Tests for scitex_ui._components._import_export (the compass L623 pattern).

The Python half is a registry metadata object, so ``check_metadata`` covers its
shape (the same convention as every other ``test__*.py`` here). The behaviour
half lives in the TypeScript module and its esbuild bundle, and this repo has no
JS test runner — so, like ``test__context_menu.py``, it is verified statically:
recompute the emitted BEM classes and the event contract from source and compare
them against the stylesheet and the shipped bundle. The point is the CROSS-
language agreement (what the module writes is styled, and what the event is
named), which no single-language check can see.
