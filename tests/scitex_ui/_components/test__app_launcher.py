"""Tests for scitex_ui._components._app_launcher (compass L624).

The Python half is a registry metadata object, so ``check_metadata`` covers
its shape. The behaviour half lives in the TypeScript module and its esbuild
bundle; this repo has no JS test runner, so it is verified statically — the
same approach as ``test__context_menu.py`` and ``test__import_export.py``.
The DOM regression test lives in ``tests/scitex_ui/ts/app-launcher.render.test.ts``
and is run directly by Node, not pytest.
