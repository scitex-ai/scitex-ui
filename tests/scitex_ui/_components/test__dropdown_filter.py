"""The dropdown filter must be automatic, and there must be only one matcher.

Operator directive 2026-07-28: 「普通にあいまい検索でフィルタはいつも入れてください」
— a long picker always gets a fuzzy filter. An opt-in flag would satisfy the
letter of that and fail it in practice, because some caller always forgets. So
the filter turns itself on above a threshold, and these tests assert that
default rather than the option's existence.

The second concern is sharper: two lists that filter DIFFERENTLY are worse
than one list that does not filter at all, because the user learns the first
one lied. Hence one matcher, shared.
