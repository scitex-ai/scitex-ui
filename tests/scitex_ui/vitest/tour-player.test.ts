/**
 * Tour player: language switching that does not lose the viewer's place.
 *
 * SSOT: scitex-hub PR 923 §8 — "The player can switch audio/subtitle language
 * without losing position", "Stable IDs/data attributes, not translated labels,
 * locate controls" (that one is the recording pipeline's whole footing), and
 * "Record both EN and JA UI locales from the same action timeline".
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS IN THIS SHAPE. The expensive failure of a bilingual
 * player is not that a language is missing; it is that switching one SILENTLY
 * restarts the video, which a user experiences as losing their place — and the
 * second language is exactly what a JA researcher switches to mid-tour. So the
 * assertions below are about POSITION and about the two language choices staying
 * independent, not about labels.
