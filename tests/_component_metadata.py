"""The component-metadata sanity check, in one place.

WHY THIS IS NOT IN A conftest ANY MORE, measured 2026-09-17 in this repo:

    pytest tests                                      -> 1701 passed, 0 errors
    pytest tests/scitex_ui/_components                ->  144 passed, 0 errors
    pytest <64 explicit test-file paths from different directories> \
        -> 24 errors: fixture 'check_metadata' not found

The CI shard runner does NOT pass directories: it builds an explicit weighted list
of test FILE paths and passes those (`pytest-matrix.yml`, the `mapfile -t
TEST_FILES` step). In that shape the subdirectory conftest stops contributing the
fixture to its own tests, at a threshold between 63 and 64 files, with no conftest
import error reported anywhere — while the same file list run as directories, or
in smaller batches, is clean. That is a pytest collection-shape interaction, not a
test defect, and it made every PR in this repo red.

The ROOT conftest is loaded for every test under tests/ regardless of how the
arguments are spelled, so the fixture lives there now. The check itself moved to
this module so that both conftests can reference one implementation without
importing each other (a conftest is not a library, however importable it looks).

    Either asset may be ``None``: a component can be CSS-only (the nine

    is what forced monaco-editor to bypass this helper with a hand-written
