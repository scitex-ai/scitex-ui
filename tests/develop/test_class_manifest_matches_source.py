"""The shipped class manifest must equal what the TypeScript source declares.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not for this package's own benefit.

A consumer that lints CSS against scitex-ui's shell needs to know which classes
this package RENDERS. That fact is not recoverable from the string:

    .stx-shell-sidebar__header          a real shell element   -> their rule fires
    .stx-shell-sidebar__header-compact  a consumer's own class -> it must not

No grammar separates those two. The difference is whether WE render it, which is
a fact about this tree and nowhere else. Before this manifest existed, the only
way for a consumer to know was to copy a list by hand across a package
boundary — and then NOTHING HERE FAILED when we added an element. Their table
went stale silently, which is detection loss by construction: the rule still
runs, still passes, and simply sees less.

THIS GUARD IS THE WHOLE POINT, not the JSON. Shipping a manifest without it
would be a hand-maintained list with extra steps. With it, adding a component or
an element and forgetting to regenerate is OUR red, here, in our own suite —
the staleness moves from their invisible gap to our visible failure.

A NATIVE CLIENT NEEDS THE SAME DATA FOR A STRONGER REASON. iOS and Android
cannot read a stylesheet at all, so this vocabulary either exists as data or it
does not exist for them. That upgrades the manifest from a courtesy to a
consumer into this package's own interface.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ENUMERATE:

    MODIFIERS are listed but are NOT the contract. A consumer should match them
    by GRAMMAR — ``<entry>(?:--[\\w-]+)?`` — because modifiers are open-ended
    state. They appear here so a consumer can write fixtures, not so they can
    build a table that goes stale on the next state we add.

    CALLER-SUPPLIED classes cannot be enumerated at all. Several call sites add
    whatever a caller passes. The manifest therefore declares itself a LOWER
    BOUND *in its own payload* — a manifest presented as complete is a gate that
    cannot fail wearing a list.
