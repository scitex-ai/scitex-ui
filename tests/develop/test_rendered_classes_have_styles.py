"""Half-pair drift guard, PRODUCER direction.

A class WRITTEN by this package's code (ts/ or react/) must be STYLED by
this package's css/ — unless it sits on the reasoned ceiling below.

Mirror of tests/develop/test_shell_layout_classes_have_writers.py (consumer
direction: a styled class must have a writer). The two directions fail
differently:

    consumer with no producer   a rule that can never match — nearly always
                                a bug (shipped first, commit 23c1c30)
    producer with no consumer   markup carrying a class no stylesheet
                                touches — sometimes intentional (inline
                                styling, structural hooks), sometimes a
                                feature that silently renders unstyled

The consumer guard's ceiling ratchet is adopted here, and so is the lesson
from its first draft: a denominator guard must assert a FLOOR, not mere
non-emptiness.

EXTRACTOR IS CONTEXT-AWARE BY CONSTRUCTION. The 2026-09-10 calibration
sweep matched 57 namespaced strings in ts/ + react/; 26 of them were NOT
class writes: 12 element IDs (getElementById, the SIDEBAR_IDS array), 9
localStorage keys, the stx-mount META name, a CustomEvent name, a CSS
custom property (--stx-verdict-*) and a config storageKey default. A
string-keyed detector reading those as classes would have shipped an
amnesty list of infrastructure names. Only class-ASSIGNMENT syntax counts:

    className = "x" | 'x' | `x` | `prefix${...}`
    classList.add / remove / toggle("x")
    class="x" inside HTML template strings
    const CLS = "base"  +  `${CLS}...`   (grammar imported from
                                          test_class_manifest_matches_source —
                                          the shipped consumer of the same
                                          convention; one source for it)

A dynamic class `base--${kind}` enters as the FAMILY ``base--``; it is
covered when any styled selector extends that base (open modifier set, the
same convention the manifest declares).
