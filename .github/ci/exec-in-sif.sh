#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Outer apptainer-exec wrapper for scitex-ui's self-hosted CI.
#
# Runs ON THE RUNNER (outside the SIF). Resolves the apptainer binary + SIF
# image, then `apptainer exec`s the SIF and hands off to an INNER script (run
# inside the container). Keeps every workflow job's YAML down to one line —
# `bash .github/ci/exec-in-sif.sh <inner-script> [args...]` — and concentrates
# all the SIF plumbing (binary resolution, ~-expansion, scratch, binds) in one
# version-controlled place.
#
# HOST-INDEPENDENT BY CONSTRUCTION. This script used to assume Spartan in four
# places — a required apptainer path under ~/.env-3.11, a PATH prepend to that
# directory, an APPTAINER_TMPDIR under /data/gpfs/projects/punim0264, and an
# unconditional --bind of that same tree. On a runner without them it failed at
# the mkdir, before the apptainer path was even consulted. Each is now used
# WHEN PRESENT and skipped when absent, so the same script works on Spartan and
# on a plain Linux runner. Measured 2026-08-05: scitex-compute-01/02 carry
# apptainer at /usr/bin/apptainer and have no /data/gpfs and no ~/.env-3.11.
#
# Optional env (repo Actions Variables — overrides, not requirements):
#   SCITEX_CI_APPTAINER   path to a specific apptainer binary
#                         (Spartan: ~/.env-3.11/bin/apptainer)
#   SCITEX_CI_SIF         path to the CI SIF image
#                         (default: ~/.scitex/dev/containers/ci-cpu.sif)
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/ci/exec-in-sif.sh run-in-sif.sh 3.12
#
# Fail-loud (operator directive): a missing apptainer or SIF is a HARD error —
# never a silent fallback to a bare-runner install. What changed is WHERE we
# look, not whether we fail when it is absent.
